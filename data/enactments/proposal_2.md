[THESIS] — Original proposal
Summary: Introduce a fair-compensation charter outlining transparent wage bands, automatic cost-of-living adjustments, and structured dispute-resolution pathways to ensure predictable, balanced outcomes. Current state: Compensation policies lack explicit balancing requirements between employee well-being, stakeholder stability, and economic resilience, leaving disputes ad hoc. Proposed change: Adopt a charter requiring (1) publicly documented wage bands for all roles, (2) an annual cost-of-living adjustment indexed to a rolling inflation metric with gradual phase-in when macro volatility is high, (3) an impartial dispute-resolution panel empowered to fast-track compensation grievances while ensuring representation from labor, management, and finance stakeholders. Evidence: Recent internal surveys show rising dissatisfaction tied to opaque pay practices; economic data indicates that predictable COLA adjustments stabilize retention and planning; balanced panels reduce escalations per mediation research. Alignment check: This strengthens @fair_compensation while safeguarding @economic_stability via gradual implementation, honors @balanced_stakeholders by distributing representation, and formalizes @dispute_resolution so grievances resolve without destabilizing DAHAO’s operations.
Required next steps: Open discussion for minimum 7 days following thesis → gather antitheses → iterate toward synthesis.
